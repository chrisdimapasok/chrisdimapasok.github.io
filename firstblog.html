A lot of people ask me what I do for work. 

</p>

<p>

What is bioinformatics? Do you use computers? Are you a biologist? What do data scientists, software engineers, computational biologists even do?

To answer that question, the best way I can put it is this: I am a computational biologist who uses computers and biological data to solve problems. 

</p>


<p>

What types of problems? It really depends. At my current company, we have a technology machine that generates tons of biological data. I won’t get into the specifics, but the end result after using the technology is a dataset containing the amount of protein levels on over 11,000 different proteins in the body. Say we have 100 individuals, that we want to look at. We can then get 100 individuals and look at each of their protein levels and analyze any trends we see.

</p>


<p>

There are endless possibilities with this data. Scientists can use this data to predict the likelihood of disease based on a person’s molecular signatures. Super powerful. 

We can also use this data to find additional drug targets. For instance, let’s say we look at a healthy individual’s protein data and compare it to a person with Alzheimer’s disease. We can then identify protein targets in those Alzheimer’s patients, and develop therapeutics that target those proteins.

The COVID vaccine itself was developed by targeting a specific spike protein on the COVID virus. This spike protein structure attaches to the ACE2 receptor on our cells and infects us. 

This simply would not have been possible without the availability of proteomic and genomic data.



</p>


<p>

Overall, these are just a couple examples of things that we can do with data. The crazy part about it is that we’re just scratching the surface on understanding the molecular processes in the human body and disease. But we continue to make strides with evolving technologies and innovating novel approaches to find more answers to solve disease. Hopefully one day, we can get to these answers. For now, we will keep working until we do.
