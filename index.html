       <h1>Hi, my name is Chris Dimapasok.</h1>
       <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
       <p> I'm Chris and I work as a Bioinformatician/Data Scientist at a Biotechnology company called SomaLogic. I graduated from UCLA in 2020 (yes I had a online COVID graduation ceremony) with a degree in Molecular Cellular and Developmental Biology and completed my Master's Degree in Bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins University. In my current role, I do everything from carrying out cool data science projects on large proteomics clinical datasets. I also build machine learning models to predict likelihood of disease, develop software tools documentation, and assist other collaborators, academic institutions, and biotechnology customers on their study design and best data practices. </p>
